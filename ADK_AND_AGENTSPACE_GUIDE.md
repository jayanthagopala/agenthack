## Agent Development Kit (ADK)

> **Official Documentation**: [google.github.io/adk-docs](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)  
> **Quickstart Guide**: [ADK Quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-development-kit/quickstart)  
> **Introduction Blog**: [ADK Introduction](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/agent-development-kit-easy-to-build-multi-agent-applications)

### What is ADK?

Agent Development Kit (ADK) is a **flexible and modular framework** for developing and deploying AI agents. While optimized for Gemini and the Google ecosystem, ADK is:

- **Model-agnostic**: Works with various AI models
- **Deployment-agnostic**: Deploy anywhere (local, cloud, hybrid)
- **Framework-compatible**: Integrates with LangChain, CrewAI, and others
- **Production-ready**: v1.0.0 for Python, v0.1.0 for Java

### ADK Architecture

ADK provides three core agent types for different use cases:

#### 1. LLM Agents (`LlmAgent`, `Agent`)
- **Purpose**: Intelligent reasoning, natural language processing, dynamic decisions
- **Core Engine**: Large Language Models (Gemini, etc.)
- **Behavior**: Non-deterministic, flexible responses
- **Best For**: Conversational AI, complex reasoning, adaptive workflows

```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent

agent = Agent(
    name="financial_advisor",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    description="Personal financial assistant",
    instruction="Help users with financial planning and advice",
    tools=[calculate_budget, check_credit_score]
)
```

#### 2. Workflow Agents (`SequentialAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, `LoopAgent`)
- **Purpose**: Control execution flow of other agents
- **Core Engine**: Predefined logic patterns
- **Behavior**: Deterministic, predictable execution
- **Best For**: Structured processes, orchestration, multi-step workflows

```python
from google.adk.agents import SequentialAgent

workflow = SequentialAgent(
    name="loan_processing",
    agents=[
        application_intake_agent,
        credit_check_agent,
        approval_agent
    ]
)
```

#### 3. Custom Agents (extending `BaseAgent`)
- **Purpose**: Implement unique business logic and integrations
- **Core Engine**: Custom code
- **Behavior**: Fully customizable
- **Best For**: Specialized requirements, unique integrations, legacy system connections

### Key ADK Features

| Feature | Description | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Multi-Agent Systems** | Hierarchical agent coordination | Complex business workflows |
| **Rich Tool Ecosystem** | Built-in tools + custom functions | API integrations, calculations |
| **Session Management** | Persistent conversations & state | Long-running interactions |
| **Deployment Flexibility** | Local, Cloud Run, GKE, Agent Engine | Any infrastructure setup |
| **Built-in Evaluation** | Performance assessment framework | Quality assurance, testing |
| **Safety & Security** | Trustworthy agent patterns | Enterprise compliance |

### ADK Development Workflow

1. **Design**: Choose agent types (LLM, Workflow, Custom)
2. **Develop**: Build agents with tools and instructions
3. **Test**: Use `adk web` for interactive testing
4. **Evaluate**: Assess performance with built-in evaluation
5. **Deploy**: Scale with Agent Engine or custom infrastructure

### Installation & Setup

```bash
# Install ADK
pip install google-adk

# Set up environment
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="your-project-id"
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION="us-central1"
export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI="True"

# Test with web interface
adk web

# Or run from command line
adk run your_agent
```
